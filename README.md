# tic-tac-toe

Motivation came from the "final project" of some of my friends' high school AP Computer Science course.

Teaching material, specifically skeleton code and scaffolding for high schoolers to read through and fill-in.

This repo contains my implementation of the entire tic-tac-toe game.

Game is played through the terminal window. I have plans to create a version of this project with a GUI in the future.
